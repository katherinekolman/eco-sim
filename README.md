# eco-sim
This project is based on Daniel Shiffman's [Evolutionary Steering Behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flxOkx0yLrY). For this project, I'm using [Processing](https://processing.org/) and the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.

The simulation can be found [here](https://katherinekolman.github.io/genetic-simulation/).

## What is this?

This project aims to simulate simple evolution through the use of genetic algorithms and reinforcement-based neural networks.


## Project Goals
There are a few things I want to accomplish with this project:

 * Learn more about genetic algorithms and neural networks along with ways to implement them.

 * Learn more about Processing.
 * Improve JavaScript skills.

## Resources
Languages
* JavaScript ([p5.js](https://p5js.org/))
* HTML/CSS (with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/))

Art
