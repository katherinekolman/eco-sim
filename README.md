# eco-sim
This project is based on Daniel Shiffman's [Evolutionary Steering Behavior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flxOkx0yLrY). For this project, I'm using [Processing](https://processing.org/) and the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. The simulation can be found [here](https://katherinekolman.github.io/eco-sim/).

This project aims to simulate simple evolution through the use of genetic algorithms.
